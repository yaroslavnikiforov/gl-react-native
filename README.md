If you are using Expo, it is recommended to use `gl-react-expo` instead.

`gl-react-native` is the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) implementation of [gl-react](https://github.com/gre/gl-react). It is in fact backed by [unimodules](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) and [expo-gl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-gl).

## Install

You will have to set up `react-native-unimodules` as documented here: https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules

**You will need to setup react-native-unimodules**

```
yarn add react-native-unimodules
```

If it's the first time you install `react-native-unimodules`, you will have to carefully follow the documentation to configure your project:
[configure unimodules](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) (if not yet done)

**You can then install gl-react dependencies:**

```
yarn add gl-react gl-react-native
```
